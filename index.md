# About Me

## PhD Candidate in Control, Stability, and Stabilization Theory

I am a PhD student working under the joint supervision of **[Antoine Chaillet](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/chaillet-antoine/)** (L2S, CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University) and **[Amaury Hayat](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~hayata/)** (CERMICS, École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées) since September 2022. My research focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of control systems, particularly in the areas of stability and stabilization.

### Research Interests

- **Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems**: Analysis and control of systems with inherent time delays.
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**: Studying dynamics and control of systems modeled by PDEs.
- **Lyapunov Theory**: Using Lyapunov-based methods for stability analysis.
- **Halanay and Razumikhin Approaches**: Techniques for analyzing delay differential systems.
- **Input-to-State Stability (ISS)**: Investigating robust stability properties of nonlinear systems.
- **Asymptotic and Exponential Stability**: Stability concepts crucial for system behavior over time.
- **Fredholm Backstepping Method**: Advanced control design for systems governed by PDEs.

### Background and Expertise

Since beginning my PhD journey, I have developed expertise in various mathematical and control theory techniques that are essential for advancing the field of stability and stabilization. My work addresses both theoretical challenges and practical applications, contributing to the broader understanding of systems with delays and complex dynamics.
