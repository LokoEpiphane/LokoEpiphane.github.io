# About Me

## PhD Candidate in Control, Stability, and Stabilization Theory

I am currently pursuing a PhD under the joint supervision of **[Antoine Chaillet](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/chaillet-antoine/)** (L2S, CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University) and **[Amaury Hayat](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~hayata/)** (CERMICS, École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées), since September 2022. My research is focused on control theory, specifically on the stability and stabilization of infinite-dimensional systems, including time-delay systems and partial differential equations (PDEs).

### Research Interests

- **Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems**: Investigating the behavior and control of systems with inherent delays.
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**: Studying control strategies for systems governed by PDEs.
- **Lyapunov Methods**: Applying Lyapunov-based techniques for analyzing system stability.
- **Halanay and Razumikhin Approaches**: Using these methods to study delay differential systems.
- **Input-to-State Stability (ISS)**: Examining the robustness of nonlinear systems under external disturbances.
- **Asymptotic and Exponential Stability**: Exploring stability conditions to ensure long-term system performance.
- **Fredholm Backstepping**: Implementing this method for rapid stabilization of systems, particularly those modeled by PDEs.
