# About Me

## PhD Candidate in Control, Stability, and Stabilization Theory

I am currently pursuing a PhD under the joint supervision of **[Antoine Chaillet](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/chaillet-antoine/)** (L2S, CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University) and **[Amaury Hayat](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~hayata/)** (CERMICS, École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées), since September 2022. My research is focused on control theory, specifically on the stability and stabilization of finite and infinite-dimensional systems, including time-delay systems and partial differential equations (PDEs).
